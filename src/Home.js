                <p></p>
                <h3>Calling All Energy Healers & Lightworkers.</h3>
                <p>The trees are calling for symbiosis. They consciously connect with humans so that healing & wholeness naturally flow from our cells to our Soul.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Let us band together and offer this same life-giving support and healing to each and every tree on our beautiful planet.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h3>What We Are About</h3>
                <p>We bring this website to the Global Community with two intentions.</p>
                <ul className="Bullets">
                    <li>To explore and learn about the deeper, metaphysical gifts trees bring to us.</li>
                    <li>To teach techniques such as visualizations that create healthy trees.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 className="TextCenter Highlights">Let us contribute to the wellbeing of trees and allow trees to contribute to our wellbeing</h4>
                <p></p>
                <h3>To Our Global Community</h3>
                <p>Metaphysical is the spiritual aspect of the physical.</p>
                <p>Visualization is the gateway to perfect health & balance.</p>
                <p>Together we can all bring perfect health and balance to all trees through metaphysical visualization. Energy healing is a gift that lies dormant within every Soul on earth.</p>
                <p>Consciousness is the key. Allowing is how we open the door to our gifts. There are many types of healing modalities. You may choose to receive these abilities by asking your mind, body, Soul, Spirit Guides & God to show you the healing gifts that will bring you the most joy in your life.</p>
